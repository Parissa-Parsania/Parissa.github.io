        <p class="intro">
            My name is Parissa, which means like an angel in Persian(Farsi). I am 32, married,originally from Iran and based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
        </p>
          <h4>My Educational Background and Working Experience:</h4>
          <p>
              I have a master's in Chemical Engineering with 2 years of experience working as a Tutor and 4 years of expereince as a Sales Support.
          </p>
          <h4>What am I doing here?</h4>
          <p>
              After my migration to The Netherlands (by my husband’s Highly Skill Migrant Visa) on Oct 2019, I immediately started looking for a job in Sales which I had 4 years of experience in. I attended many interviews and heard so many No! The main challenges were not knowing Dutch and not having work experience in The Netherlands. <br>
But the Corona Virus crisis gave me the chance to start thinking about the <em>changes I want to make in my life</em>. Fortunately, I had a very nice conversation with Ms. Hilde Helsen, the author of "Dreamers Who Do", and she asked me to think about my dream jobs and dream companies to work.<br> 
It was the time I realized I was not the one who had decided for my university major and even my previous job (Unfortunately, due to the economic problems and the high rate of unemployment in Iran, people usually don’t have the freedom to choose their own path and follow their dreams). <br>
So, I decided to take my life in a completely new direction; <strong>Programming!</strong>

        <h6>Posted on 19.8.2020</h6>
        <p>
            It takes <strong>courage</strong> to start something that puts you in a precarious state of uncertainty but I believe once you choose a (fresh) new start, something that is closer to your heart and your own path, it creates a certain drive and enthusiasm, which ensures quality and cannot go unnoticed.<br>
Besides; <br>
The web developer position is usually among<em> the Top10 most in-demand jobs in the world </em>and it is one of the jobs that not only survived during the pandemic but also with the high demand for online education, remote learning, online shopping, and etcetera, there will be even more opportunities to work.<br>
 There is the possibility to work from home or abroad and work remotely for developers which are great advantages in the world's current situation.<br>
My husband who is working as a frontend developer can be a great mentor for me. although he is busy working 8 hours a day, I have the chance to ask for his help when needed.<br>
To make sure if programming is the right choice for me that I can enjoy and be successful in, I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Sep 2020 through online free websites and YouTube videos. <br>
With my husband’s support recently, I have deployed my own website which is still in very first steps but makes me more motivated to work and develop it:<br>

Currently I am doing <strong>Hack Your Future</strong> application assignements and I hope to be accepted in their next class in Oct 2020. wish me luck!! :)<br>
